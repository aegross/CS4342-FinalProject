(explanation of dataset)

## Machine Learning Models
### Simple Model: Softmax Regression w/ Stochastic Gradient Descent
Implementation of softmax regression was taken from the third homework from the same course, and altered to work with 
the dataset used for this project.

### Deep Model: ???
### Final Model: ???

## Run Instructions:
data-cleaning.py is designed to be run once from the source folder as the main set to retrieve the dataset from kaggle.
